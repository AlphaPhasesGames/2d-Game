	 "stage1Text3": "During this adventure we will learn about the rock cycle and its steps in greater detail and begin to understand how rocks are formed.",
	 "stage1Text4": "There is a journal just up ahead on that section of raised ground. Can you grab it please? Just walk over it to pick it up.",
	 "stage1Text5": "You can move around with the WASD keys or the arrow keys. Let's go get the journal now.",
	 "stage1Text6": "Excellent work. It's important to know that rocks are made of minerals. Each rock has a different composition of minerals and we will have a go at creating our own rocks later on.",
	 "stage1Text7": "The regional metamorphism of rock is a slow geological process but one that is crucial to the rock cycle.",
	 "stage1Text8": "Before we can proceed underground we have a few tasks we need to complete. Can you please search the surface of this island for an object made of minerals.",
	 "stage1Text9": "When you find the object can you please bring it back here? You can use the E key to pick it up and carry it.",
	 "stage1Text10": "You can open your journal by pressing J or clicking the inventory button in the top right with your mouse or touchpad. Just in case you forget anything you've learned.",

	 "stage1Text13": "You found a rock! Unlike plastic or wood, rocks are made up of minerals, naturally occurring substances with a definite chemical composition. This rock is a mix of several different minerals that give it its color, hardness, and texture. Let's take it back to the raised ground we found our journal on.",
	 "stage1Text14": "This rock is basalt. It is a dark rock that forms when lava, cooled quickly in the earths surface. It is composed of minerals, like pyroxene and feldspar, give it strength and a deep color.",
	 "stage1Text15": "Here is a diagram of the rock cycle. Like the water cycle it is cyclical. It doesn't start or end in one place but instead is a constant process that is self-sustaining and one that relies on external and internal sources of energy to keep going.",
	 "stage1Text16": "The 7 steps are uplift, weathering, erosion, deposition, melting, crystallization, and metamorphism.",
	 "stage1Text17": "Let's tackle our next task. Around this island there are 7 chests with a piece of paper in each. Can you collect all 7 please and come back here so we can put them in their place on this diagram?",
	 "stage1Text18": "Press E to open a chest and collect its contents.",
	 "stage1Text19": "Well done, that's our first chest opened and it seems that we found some gems as well as the piece of paper we were looking for. Let's find the final 6 chests.",

	 "stage1Text26": "One last task to complete.",
	 "stage1Text27": "There is a large boulder blocking the cave underground. Can you search for two switches on the island that will move the boulder? There are 4 switches in total but only 2 move the boulders.",
	 "stage1Text28": "Can you please search for the two switches that represent what moves and changes during the rock cycle? You can check your journal if you have forgotten.",
	 "stage1Text29": "This switch must be wrong because the boulder didn't move. Check your journal and try another switch please.",
	 "stage1Text30": "Does energy cycle from one form or to another during the rock cycle? Press E if you think this is correct or walk away if you think it is wrong.",

	 "stage1Text33": "Does air resistance cycle from one form or to another during the rock cycle? Press E if you think this is correct or walk away if you think it is wrong.",
	 "stage1Text34": "Fantastic. Energy moves from once form to another during the rock cycle. One more switch to go.",
	 "stage1Text35": "Excellent. Matter moves from once form to another during the rock cycle.",
	 "stage1Text36": "The boulder has moved and we can progress underground. Head into the cave to start exploring the caverns below the island.",
	 "stage1TextAllBottlesCollected": "That’s the surface all cleaned up, no more plastic bottles! Thank you for helping protect and preserve this beautiful island. Oh, look! Some gems were lying under the last bottle. Let’s take them!",
	 "stage1RCStep1": "Uplift - Movements inside the Earth push rocks from deep underground up to the surface. This often happens during mountain-building or plate movement, exposing older rocks to wind, rain, and other surface conditions.",
	 "stage1RCStep2": "Weathering - Once exposed, rocks break down through rain, temperature changes, wind, and plant roots. These processes slowly crack, crumble, and dissolve the rock into smaller pieces called sediments.",
	 "stage1RCStep3": "Erosion - Erosion moves sediments away from where they formed. Water, wind, ice, or gravity carry the broken rock particles across the land or into rivers and oceans.",
	 "stage1RCStep4": "Deposition - Sediments eventually settle out of moving water or wind and pile up in layers. Over time, these layers build thick deposits on riverbeds, beaches, or the ocean floor.",
	 "stage1RCStep5": "Melting - When rocks are pushed deep into the Earth, extreme heat melts them into molten rock, or magma. This is the first step in forming new igneous rocks below the surface.",
	 "stage1RCStep6": "Crystallization - As magma cools, underground or after erupting as lava, it hardens and forms mineral crystals. These interlocking crystals create solid igneous rocks like granite or basalt.",
	 "stage1RCStep7": "Metamorphism - Metamorphism occurs when existing rocks are changed by intense heat and pressure inside the Earth without melting. Their minerals rearrange, forming new metamorphic rocks like marble or schist",
