	 "stage1Text2": "We’re here because we have reports that the rock cycle on this island has stopped and we need to restart it.",
	 "stage1Text3": "During this adventure we will learn about the rock cycle and its steps in greater detail and begin to understand how rocks are formed.",
	 "stage1Text4": "There is a journal just up ahead on that section of raised ground. Can you grab it please? Just walk over it to pick it up.",
	 "stage1Text5": "You can move around with the WASD keys or the arrow keys. Let's go get the journal now.",
	 "stage1Text6": "Excellent work. It's important to know that rocks are made of minerals. Each rock has a different composition of minerals and we will have a go at creating our own rocks later on.",
	 "stage1Text7": "The regional metamorphism of rock is a slow geological process but one that is crucial to the rock cycle.",
	 "stage1Text8": "Before we can proceed underground we have a few tasks we need to complete. Can you please search the surface of this island for an object made of minerals.",
	 "stage1Text9": "When you find the object can you please bring it back here? You can use the E key to pick it up and carry it.",
	 "stage1Text10": "You can open your journal by clicking the inventory button in the top right with your mouse or touchpad. Just in case you forget anything you've learned.",
	 "stage1Text11": "Let's get going.",
	 "stage1Text12": "This object appears to be made of organic matter. We are looking for an object made of minerals.",
	 "stage1Text13": "Fantastic, rocks are made of minerals. Lets take it back to the raised ground we found our journal on.",
	 "stage1Text14": "Now that we have found our rock. Let's talk about the rock cycle in greater detail.",
	 "stage1Text15": "Here is a diagram of the rock cycle. Like the water cycle it is cyclical. It doesn't start or end in one place but instead is a constant process that is self-sustaining and one that relies on external and internal sources of energy to keep going.",
	 "stage1Text16": "The 7 steps are uplift, weathering, erosion, deposition, melting, crystallization, and metamorphism.",
	 "stage1Text17": "Let's tackle our next task. Around this island there are 7 chests with a piece of paper in each. Can you collect all 7 please and come back here so we can put them in their place on this diagram?",
	 "stage1Text18": "Press E to open a chest and collect its contents.",
	 "stage1Text19": "Well done, that's our first chest opened and it seems that we found some gems as well as the piece of paper we were looking for. Let's find the final 6 chests.",
	 "stage1Text20": "That's all the chests and pieces of paper found. Let’s return to the wooden board with the diagram on and put these in place.",
	 "stage1Text21": "Here is the diagram again but the labels are missing. Can you click on all the stages you feel are correct. There are incorrect choices so be careful which ones you choose. You can check the journal if you have forgotten.",
	 "stage1Text22": "Are you sure that is a correct step in the rock cycle? Have a look at your journal and try again.",
	 "stage1Text23": "Excellent. 6 more to go.",
	 "stage1Text24": "That's fantastic. You have completed the diagram and now we can see the steps of the rock cycle and their relative positions. We are almost ready to go underground.",
	 "stage1Text25": "It is important to know at this point that geologic processes, such as the rock and water cycles, involve the cycling of energy and matter from one form to another.",
	 "stage1Text26": "One last task to complete.",
	 "stage1Text27": "There is a large boulder blocking the cave underground. Can you search for two switches on the island that will move the boulder? There are 4 switches in total but only 2 move the boulders.",
	 "stage1Text28": "Can you please search for the two switches that represent what moves and changes during the rock cycle? You can check your journal if you have forgotten.",
	 "stage1Text29": "This switch must be wrong because the boulder didn't move. Check your journal and try another switch please.",
	 "stage1Text30": "Fantastic. Energy is moved during the rock cycle. One more switch to go.",
	 "stage1Text31": "xcellent. Matter is also moved during the rock cycle. The boulder has moved and we can progress underground. Head into the cave to start exploring the caverns below the island."
