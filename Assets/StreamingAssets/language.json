	 "stage1Text4": "There is a journal just up ahead on that section of raised ground. Can you grab it please? Just walk over it to pick it up.",
	 "stage1Text5": "You can move around with the WASD keys or the arrow keys. Let's go get the journal now.",
	 "stage1Text6": "Excellent work. It's important to know that rocks are made of minerals. Each rock has a different composition of minerals and we will have a go at creating our own rocks later on.",
	 "stage1Text7": "The regional metamorphism of rock is a slow geological process but one that is crucial to the rock cycle.",
	 "stage1Text8": "Before we can proceed underground we have a few tasks we need to complete. Can you please search the surface of this island for an object made of minerals?",
	 "stage1Text9": "When you find the object can you please bring it back here? You can use the E key to pick it up and carry it.",

	 "stage1Text13": "You found an igneous rock! Unlike plastic, rocks are made of minerals, naturally occurring substances with a definite chemical makeup. This rock contains several minerals that give it its color, hardness, and texture. Let’s take it back to the raised ground where we found the journal.",
	 "stage1Text14": "This igneous rock is basalt. It is a dark rock that forms when lava is cooled quickly at the Earth's surface. It is composed of minerals like pyroxene and feldspar, which give it strength and a deep color.",
	 "stage1Text15": "Here is a diagram of the rock cycle. Like the water cycle it is cyclical. It doesn't start or end in one place but instead is a constant process that is self-sustaining and one that relies on external and internal sources of energy to keep going.",
	 "stage1Text16": "The 7 steps are uplift, weathering, erosion, deposition, melting, crystallization, and metamorphism.",
	 "stage1Text17": "Let's tackle our next task. Around this island there are 7 chests with a piece of paper in each. Can you collect all 7 please and come back here so we can put them in their place on this diagram?",
	 "stage1Text18": "Press E to open a chest and collect its contents.",
	 "stage1Text19": "Well done, that's our first chest opened and it seems that we found some gems as well as the piece of paper we were looking for. Let's find the final 6 chests.",

	 "stage1Text21": "Here’s the diagram again without labels. Don’t drag anything- Just click the stages you think are correct. Some choices are wrong, so pick carefully. You can check the Journal if you need a reminder.",
	 "stage1Text22": "Are you sure that is a correct step in the rock cycle? Have a look at your journal and try again.",
	 "stage1Text23": "Excellent. 6 more to go.",

	 "stage1Text26": "One last task to complete.",
	 "stage1Text27": "There is a large boulder blocking the cave underground. Can you search for two switches on the island that will move the boulder? There are 4 switches in total but only 2 move the boulders.",
	 "stage1Text28": "Can you please search for the two switches that represent what moves and changes during the rock cycle? You can check your journal if you have forgotten.",
	 "stage1Text29": "This switch must be wrong because the boulder didn't move. Check your journal and try another switch please.",
	 "stage1Text30": "Does energy cycle from one form or to another during the rock cycle? Press E if you think this is correct or walk away if you think it is wrong.",
	 "stage1Text31": "Does matter cycle from one form or to another during the rock cycle? Press E if you think this is correct or walk away if you think it is wrong.",

	 "stage1Text33": "Does air resistance cycle from one form or to another during the rock cycle? Press E if you think this is correct or walk away if you think it is wrong.",
	 "stage1Text34": "Fantastic. Energy moves from one form to another during the rock cycle. One more switch to go.",
	 "stage1Text35": "Excellent. Matter moves from one form to another during the rock cycle.",
	 "stage1Text36": "The boulder has moved and we can progress underground. Head into the cave to start exploring the caverns below the island.",
	 "stage1TextAllBottlesCollected": "That’s the surface all cleaned up, no more plastic bottles! Thank you for helping protect and preserve this beautiful island. Oh, look! Some gems were lying under the last bottle. Let’s take them!",
	 "stage1RCStep1": "Uplift - Movements inside the Earth push rocks from deep underground up to the surface. This often happens during mountain-building or plate movement, exposing older rocks to wind, rain, and other surface conditions.",
	 "stage1RCStep2": "Weathering - Once exposed, rocks break down through rain, temperature changes, wind, and plant roots. These processes slowly crack, crumble, and dissolve the rock into smaller pieces called sediments.",
	 "stage1RCStep3": "Erosion - Erosion moves sediments away from where they formed. Water, wind, ice, or gravity carry the broken rock particles across the land or into rivers and oceans.",
	 "stage1RCStep4": "Deposition - Sediments eventually settle out of moving water or wind and pile up in layers. Over time, these layers build thick deposits on riverbeds, beaches, or the ocean floor.",
	 "stage1RCStep5": "Melting - When rocks are pushed deep into the Earth, extreme heat melts them into molten rock, or magma. This is the first step in forming new igneous rocks below the surface.",
	 "stage1RCStep6": "Crystallization - As magma cools, underground or after erupting as lava, it hardens and forms mineral crystals. These interlocking crystals create solid igneous rocks like granite or basalt.",
	 "stage1RCStep7": "Metamorphism - Metamorphism occurs when existing rocks are changed by intense heat and pressure inside the Earth without melting. Their minerals rearrange, forming new metamorphic rocks like marble or schist",

	  "stage2RCText3": "Can you collect the journal and pickaxe up ahead please?",
	  "stage2RCText4": "Fantastic. You can swing the pickaxe with the space bar. Let’s open the journal and look at the recipes for different types of rock.",
	  "stage2RCText5": "Here we have 3 recipes to create 3 types of rock, igneous, sedimentary and metamorphic. ",
	  "stage2RCText6": "To create these recipes we need to find 5 different minerals. I see clay up ahead on the mine cart tracks over the water. Let’s collect it by walking up to it and pressing E.",
	  "stage2RCText7": "Fantastic. We have our first mineral. This mineral is clay.",
	  "stage2RCText8": "Around the cave there should be 4 other types of mineral. Let's go find them. Open the map with the M key or the button top right if you get lost.",
	  "stage2RCText9": "Awesome, you found a mineral called Mica.",
	  "stage2RCText10": "Fantastic, this mineral is Calcite.",
	  "stage2RCText11": "Well done, you have found a mineral called Quartz.",
	  "stage2RCText12": "Excellent, this mineral is Feldspar.",
	  "stage2RCText13": "Now we have all 5 minerals, let’s find the machine that combines them together. You can find this machine by opening the map or following the waypoint marker.",
	  "stage2RCText14": "This machine combines minerals to create different forms of rock. It uses heat and pressure to create forms of rock like Metamorphic rock.",
	  "stage2RCText15": "It's important to know that the combination of minerals and the way in which they combine determines the properties of a rock.",

	  "stage2RCText19": "Well done, Clay and Calcite create Limestone. This is a sedimentary form of rock.",
	  "stage2RCText20": "1 combination left to create.",
	  "stage2RCText21": "Excellent, Clay and Mica create Slate, Slate is a metamorphic rock. Did you know that metamorphic rocks form from other rocks that have been changed by heat or pressure.",
	  "stage2RCText22": "This combination doesn’t create a recognised type of rock. Review your journal and try a different combination of minerals.",
	  "stage2RCText23": "Well done! That’s all three rock types created. Minerals can become igneous rock by melting and cooling, sedimentary rock by compaction and cementation, and metamorphic rock by heat and pressure. Let’s take the metamorphic rock home to study.",
	  "stage2RCText24": "Let’s leave this cave through the door at the back. Check your map if you get lost.",
	  "stage2RCText25": "We’re almost on the bottom layer of the cave, just one more task to complete.",
	  "stage2RCText26": "That's a sediment pressing machine up ahead. It will compress sediments together to create sedimentary rock.",
	  "stage2RCText27": "Sedimentary rocks form when sediments, such as sand, gravel, clay, or silt, are compressed and cemented together. ",
	  "stage2RCText28": "We're going to need to find some sediments to put in it. The journal page up ahead should help us. Let's collect it.",
	  "stage2RCText29": "We already have clay, let's look around for more sediments to compress into sedimentary rock.",
	  "stage2RCText30": "You may need to break some rocks with your pickaxe to reach them. Check your map with the M key if you get lost.",
	  "stage2RCText31": "Fantastic. This sediment is sand.",
	  "stage2RCText32": "Brilliant. This sediment is gravel.",
	  "stage2RCText33": "Awesome. This sediment is silt.",
	  "stage2RCText34": "You found some gold flakes. These can't be compressed into sedimentary rock but let's collect them anyway.",
	  "stage2RCText35": "We've found enough sediments. Let us head to the machine and compress them.",
	  "stage2RCText36": "Here we are, it's time to compress our sediments to sedimentary rock. You can add a layer by clicking a sediment on the left.",
	  "stage2RCText37": "Can you please look at the journal and see what sediments we need to make sedimentary rock?",
	  "stage2RCText38": "Well done, that's our first layer added. Let's add the other 3 layers and press the compress button.",
	  "stage2RCText39": "Looks like you added gold flakes, these can't be compressed into sedimentary rock. Remove it and try again. Check your journal if you forget the sediments we need.",
	  "stage2RCText40": "Fantastic job! You have made sedimentary rock. This sedimentary rock is called Sandstone. In nature it can take millions of years for sediments to compress.",

	 "stage1Text14": "This igneous rock is basalt. It is a dark rock that forms when lava is cooled quickly at the Earth's surface. It is composed of minerals, like pyroxene and feldspar, which give it strength and a deep color.",
	 "stage1Text15": "Here is a diagram of the rock cycle. Like the water cycle it is cyclical. It doesn't start or end in one place but instead is a constant process that is self-sustaining and one that relies on external and internal sources of energy to keep going.",

	 "stage1Text28": "Can you please search for the two switches that represent what moves and changes during the rock cycle? You can check your journal if you have forgotten.",
	 "stage1Text29": "This switch must be wrong because the boulder didn't move. Check your journal and try another switch please.",

	 "stage1RCStep1": "Uplift - Movements inside the Earth push rocks from deep underground up to the surface. This often happens during mountain-building or plate movement, exposing older rocks to wind, rain, and other surface conditions.",
	 "stage1RCStep2": "Weathering - Once exposed, rocks break down through rain, temperature changes, wind, and plant roots. These processes slowly crack, crumble, and dissolve the rock into smaller pieces called sediments.",
	 "stage1RCStep3": "Erosion - Erosion moves sediments away from where they formed. Water, wind, ice, or gravity carry the broken rock particles across the land or into rivers and oceans.",
	 "stage1RCStep4": "Deposition - Sediments eventually settle out of moving water or wind and pile up in layers. Over time, these layers build thick deposits on riverbeds, beaches, or the ocean floor.",
	 "stage1RCStep5": "Melting - When rocks are pushed deep into the Earth, extreme heat melts them into molten rock, or magma. This is the first step in forming new igneous rocks below the surface.",
	 "stage1RCStep6": "Crystallization - As magma cools, underground or after erupting as lava, it hardens and forms mineral crystals. These interlocking crystals create solid igneous rocks like granite or basalt.",
	 "stage1RCStep7": "Metamorphism - Metamorphism occurs when existing rocks are changed by intense heat and pressure inside the Earth without melting. Their minerals rearrange, forming new metamorphic rocks like marble or schist",

	  "stage2RCText23": "Well done! That’s all three rock types created. Minerals can become igneous rock by melting and cooling, sedimentary rock by compaction and cementation, and metamorphic rock by heat and pressure. Let’s take the metamorphic rock home to study.",
	  "stage2RCText24": "Let’s leave this cave through the door at the back. Check your map if you get lost.",
	  "stage2RCText25": "We’re almost on the bottom layer of the cave, just one more task to complete.",
	  "stage2RCText26": "That's a sediment pressing machine up ahead. It will compress sediments together to create sedimentary rock.",
	  "stage2RCText27": "Sedimentary rocks form when sediments, such as sand, gravel, clay, or silt, are compressed and cemented together. ",
	  "stage2RCText28": "We're going to need to find some sediments to put in it. The journal page up ahead should help us. Let's collect it.",
	  "stage2RCText29": "We already have clay, let's look around for more sediments to compress into sedimentary rock.",
	  "stage2RCText30": "You may need to break some rocks with your pickaxe to reach them. Check your map with the M key if you get lost.",
